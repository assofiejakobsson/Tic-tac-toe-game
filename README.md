## How the game works

The player is welcomed to the game. And is asked if it wants to play, read the game rules, or exit.

If the player selects game rules, the game rules will come up. And the player can choose whether to play or exit the game.

If the player chooses to exit the game, the player will receive a thank you message. And the player can choose whether to play.

If the player chooses to play, a reference board will appear showing which number belongs to the box. And below that, an empty game board appears, with a text showing who the player and the computer are. And the player gets to start choosing a square.

The player and the computer take turns choosing a free square until someone wins or until there is a tie.

The player can choose to play as many times as they want. And whoever lost the round gets to start the next game round.
